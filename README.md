# Dynamic Stack Allocation in x86 Assembly

An educational experiment: implementing heap-like dynamic memory allocation, but entirely on the stack, in 32-bit x86 NASM assembly.

## Build & Run

```bash
make        # assemble and link
make run    # run the binary and print exit code
make debug  # launch GDB
make clean  # remove build artifacts
```
